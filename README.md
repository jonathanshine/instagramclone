# Instagram Profile Clone
*A mock Instagram profile page built using React and SASS.*

With this project I would like to showcase my proficiency in using React and SASS.

I will update this README with a log about the steps I took in building the project as well discuss the challenges and things I discovered along the way.

## Process
1. I always start with building the file architecture that I believe I will need throughout the project. This can of course change, but at least I have a solid foundation upon which I can build. In this case, I created the repository first, cloned into it, and used npm to download React and SASS.
2. When I am trying to replicate a webpage I like to use a top-down approach, which most often means starting with the navigation bar and of course ending with the footer. Since I am using React, I build each component one by one, committing and pushing my code regularly along the way.
